<h3>enhancements to be</h3>
1. responsiveness ( mobile first )
2. optimized image fetch - can send over the device information using user agent ( width, display ratio) and get the perfect sized image from the server. Imagekit would be the best tool to use.
3. SPA - optimised resource fetch.
4. optimised filter , for now it only works with themes filtering.
5. minify and uglify and compress the code to reduce the size of resource sent.
6. using modules like bootstrap, jquery, lodash will add unecessary javascript and css which increases the bundle size.( but I've used it anyway as this project is for demo purpose)
7. No-js support
